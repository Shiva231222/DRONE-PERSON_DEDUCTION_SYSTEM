OBJECTIVE:- 
1.	Deduct unauthorized drone or people in real time.
2.	Distinguish like birds, plane, missile and any weapons.
3.	Provide early warning to defense/security system.
4.	Reduce manual surveillances.
Deduction Approach:
1.Use:-
  cameras & deep learning algo.
Techniques :-
•	CNN
•	Yolo, yoloVE, Faster R CNN
•	SSD
Input – Live Video/Image From CCTV/Thermal  Cemras
Output- 1. Bounding box around drone
                2.Deduct Drone Type
2.   Acoustic –Based Deduction.
	Used sound signals of drone 
	AL Model used – CNN & LSTR
3.  Radio Frequency Signals Deduct
	Deduct Drone Controller Communication 

ML Modules :- 
	SVM
	Random Forest
	CNN

4.	Radar + AI (ADVANCE DEFENCE GRADE)
•	Rader deduct objects
•	All classifiers drones V/S Birds
